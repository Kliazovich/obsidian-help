The status bar shows small bits of information in the bottom right corner of the window. That includes helpful information about the current file, the current vault, or the current status like time and date.

Status items are added both by [[Базавыя плагіны|core plugins]] and [[Плагіны супольнасці]]. Some items are interactive but some are purely informational. 

For example, the [[word count]] plugin adds the word and character count that’s not clickable, and the [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Sync plugin]] adds an icon that both shows the sync status as well as shows the sync log upon being clicked. 

The desktop version of the status bar pictured below features information about the [[Backlinks|backlinks]] present, the current [[Edit and preview Markdown#Editor views|editor view]], and the current word and character count from the word count plugin.
