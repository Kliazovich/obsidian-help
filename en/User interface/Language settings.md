The Obsidian interface has been translated to various languages by [[Credits#Translators|our amazing volunteer translators]]. You can change the interface language either in **Settings** ( ![[lucide-settings.svg#icon]] ) → **General** or when you create a new vault.

Don’t see your language in the list or seeing untranslated text? Consider [[Translations|help us translate Obsidian into your language]].
